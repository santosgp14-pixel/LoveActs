The AI engineer adopted an iterative, user-centric development approach for the LoveActs application, building upon a React, FastAPI, and MongoDB stack. Initially, a core MVP was delivered, focusing on user authentication, partner linking, and daily activity tracking. A crucial point was the engineer's flexibility in adapting to the user's mobile app request by offering to expand the existing web application into a Progressive Web App (PWA) rather than a native build, successfully implementing and debugging its installation. The development continued with significant feature additions such as partner-rated activities, a dedicated Mi Pareja section with mood tracking, and a Recuerdos Especiales feature. The latest phase involved refining existing UI elements and integrating a new notification system, along with expanding mood options and re-categorizing activities. The work concludes mid-implementation of these recent UI/UX and notification enhancements.

<code_architecture>
The application follows a full-stack architecture with a React frontend, FastAPI backend, and MongoDB database.



-   : The core of the FastAPI backend. It defines API endpoints for user authentication (login, registration), couple management (linking via unique codes), CRUD operations for  and  models, and logic for Recuerdos Especiales (5-star acts). Recent modifications include:
    *   Expanded  and  models to support partner-rated acts and expanded mood states.
    *   New endpoints for fetching total historical statistics ().
    *   Endpoints for partner profile customization (updating , ).
    *   New notification models (, ) and endpoints (, ) were added, and existing  and  endpoints were modified to trigger notifications to the partner.
    *   Validation for mood levels was updated to accept values from 1-10.
-   : The main React component orchestrating the entire frontend. It manages routing, state, and integrates various UI components for login, registration, dashboard, activity forms, Mi Pareja, Recuerdos Especiales, and the new Historial sections. Key changes throughout:
    *   **PWA Integration:** Implemented a  hook and  component to handle PWA updates.
    *   **Feature Integration:** Incorporated components and logic for partner-rated activities, mood tracking, Recuerdos Especiales, partner profile editing (modal for nickname/photo), and display of total historical stats.
    *   **UI Updates:** Modified to display current date, re-positioned calendar to Historial section.
    *   **Latest Changes:** The  state logic was updated to support a wider range of mood levels (1-10). The  section is currently being modified to change categories to Lenguajes del Amor and remove the Momento del día dropdown.
-   : Essential for PWA functionality. It declares the app's name, icons, start URL, display mode, and theme color. It was continuously updated to reflect new versions and correctly reference PWA icons.
-   : The Service Worker script enables offline caching and background sync capabilities for the PWA. It was simplified and configured with versioned cache names () to ensure proper updates.
-   : The main entry point for the frontend, updated to include PWA meta tags, link to , and register the  Service Worker.
-   : Contains the PWA icons. Initially placeholder files, later updated with generated SVG and then PNG icons (192x192, 512x512) to ensure PWA installability across browsers.
-    & : Store environment variables crucial for service communication (e.g., , ).

<current_work>
The AI engineer was in the process of implementing a new set of modifications requested by the user. The immediate focus was on enhancing the notification system and refining several UI elements.

On the **backend** (), new models for notifications (, ) were added. The logic to send push notifications to the partner was being integrated into existing endpoints. Specifically, the  (for logging acts of love) and  (for updating mood) endpoints are being modified to trigger these notifications automatically. Additionally, the mood validation in the backend was adjusted to accept a broader range of values (1-10) to support the expanded mood states.

On the **frontend** (), the work is ongoing for:
1.  **Expanded Mood States:** The application is being updated to display and handle a wider selection of mood states (now supporting at least 10 options) through a dropdown with corresponding emojis. This required updating frontend validation.
2.  **Home Screen Modifications:** Implementation of the user's requests for the main screen, including repositioning the app version/status text to the bottom and making the date text size smaller. The task to hide the Comparar link and show the broken heart icon when no acts are registered remains.
3.  **Añadir Acto Section:** The categories for registering acts of love are being transformed to align with the Lenguajes del Amor (words of affirmation, quality time, gifts, acts of service, physical touch). The removal of the Momento del día dropdown is also part of this ongoing work.

The last recorded action involved updating the Añadir Acto section in  with the new Lenguajes del Amor categories. The notification system is partially integrated on the backend, and the frontend UI updates are in progress.
